#Creates a connection to the database

#We are using PDO to abstract away the database type we are connecting to
#PDO allows us to connect to many different database types: MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL, Oracle, etc.


#WAMP's default user is 'root'    
#MAMP's  default user is also 'root' 
#Edumedia's username is your Algonquin username, like abcd1234
SetEnv DB_USER root

#WAMP's default password is an empty string
#MAMP's default password is 'root'
#Edumedia's password is your student number, without the first 0
SetEnv DB_PASS 

# Data Source Name
# The location and the name of the database

SetEnv DB_DSN mysql:dbname=dupe0012;host=localhost
#localhost above means the the database server is on the same computer as this PHP file
