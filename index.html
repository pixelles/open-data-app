	<h1>Open Data Application - Project Brief</h1>
	
	<h2>Description & Feature List</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Easiness</h3>
				<p>The application is designed to be easy to navigate as well as manage, the reason being is that there is a lot of content to display (splash pad locations, ratings, maps, etc), so the goal is not to overwhelm the user. A sense of easiness is achieved through defined lines, clean fonts and colours which visually belong together.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h3>Interactivity</h3>
				<p>In order to give the user an interactive experience, they are able to leave their feedback on splash pads by rating them according to their experience. </p>
				<p>Located above the list of splash pads is a tabbed list featuring a rating system that will sort the results into three categories which are based on typical concerns the audience may have, such as, “popular”, “quality” and “saftety” of the pads. The highest total score given by raters will determine the level of popularity. Quality will be decided according to the state of the splash pad (e.g.: old vs. new structures, operational reliability, etc). Last but not least, the safety level of a splash pad will be calculated according to factors such as amounts of shade (e.g.:  trees, tents or structures) available for extra sunny days, as well as surveillance available (e.g.: populated neighbourhood vs. isolated neighbourhoods).</p>
				<p>It is also important to know that not only do these ratings help a user feel as if they have contributed to the application, but it also attaches an added value to users who want real feedback about which splash pad they will introduce to their family, clients and friends.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h3>Visuals</h3>
				<p>A visual, which contributes to the website’s interactivity and easiness, is the mapping system that will be featured on the application. The user will be able to not only search for a desired or possible location, but he or she will also be able to instantly recognize which splash pads are rated highly or low, facilitating the overall online experience. The user will also have the choice to view pads located near their current location by using the ‘home’ button next to the search bar.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h3>Design</h3>
				<p>The design features bright, vibrant and youthful colours in order to attract its end user, young children. It also helps guardians understand the age group which the pads are targeted towards to.</p>

	<h2>User Persona</h2>
	<p>Katrina is a fifteen-year-old babysitter for the two Poirier children, ages eight and eleven. As a full-time babysitter for the season, she is on a hunt to find a local, safe and entertaining activity during the children’s summer vacation. The location must offer a place where she can sit back with her magazine under the shade while the children enjoy themselves as much as she is. This is when she remembers playing at her local splash pad as a kid and thus begins her search as she comes across the locator. Luckily, the locator offers more pads than she was ever aware of and allows her to plan her trip while being aware of any details such as safety and popularity of the pads.</p>
